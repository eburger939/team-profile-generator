# Homework 10 - team generator
* Due on 1/11/2022


## Description
* This project is a team generator.  The user will input answers into the terminal.  First, the user will be asked about information for the team maanger, then asked if they would like to add an enginner, intern or stop and build their team.  If an engineer/intern is selected, the user is then prompted another set of questions specific to that role.  Once the user selects to stop adding team members and build their team, an html page is created.  The HTML page will show cards for each member created, and the questions that were answered regarding that member.  Each member will have their email address listed which when clicked upon will open up an email window.  The engineer will have listed their GitHub username and when clicked upon a new tab will open to that specific github account.
